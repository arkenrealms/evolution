`arken/packages/evolution`

## Snapshot
- Files: 5
- Subfolders: 1

## Notable contents
- files: .git, .gitmodules, LICENSE, NOTES.md, README.md
- dirs: packages

## Next actions
- Resolve submodule metadata mismatch for `packages/client` (gitlink exists but missing `.gitmodules` mapping) so recursive checkout can succeed.
- Continue chunked deepest-first analysis into nested submodules/folders once checkout is unblocked.
- Add/update concise README.md coverage and path-header normalization while touching files.
