# /arken/packages/evolution/packages/README.md

Workspace container for Evolution components.

## Folders
- `client/`: client-facing runtime and SDK (currently submodule-backed).
- `protocol/`: protocol definitions and transport contracts.
- `realm/`: realm/game-state service logic.
- `shard/`: shard runtime and distributed execution logic.

This repo currently tracks these as submodules; see top-level `NOTES.md` for initialization and access blockers.
